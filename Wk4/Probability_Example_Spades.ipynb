    "Find a recent article or blog that discusses probabilities in a specific board game or card game.  Refrain from choosing common betting games, such as Blackjack, Poker (any variation), etc. Summarize the article, the analysis of the probabilities involved, and reproduce the probabilities using Python.  Are you able to reproduce the probabilities?  Why or why not?  Be sure to share a link to or a copy of your article and your Python code and output.\n",

    "### Reference\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "Growing up, my family always loved playing cards games together. We've played many types of card games over the years, almost always of the non-betting, trick-taking, partnership games. Some of the favorites included Eucher, Rummy, Hearts, Spades and probably the all-time favorite... Pinochle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's excercise, I thought it would be fitting to take a look at basic probability questions for our favorite family card games. While I orignially wanted to try this exercise for pinocle, the number of articles was somewhat limtied and the rules of the game require a more complex application of the example program I intended to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a compromise I've instead chosen to use the game of Spades. It is a great team-playing game that involves some inital probabilstic estimation of outcome based on what you have in your hand. However, it affords the possbility of looking at another probability characteristic covered inthe second of my two Scientific American articles. This explores the idea of changing the orignial question based on new information. This concept has gained somewhat mainstream understanding based on movies like '21' or 'Rainman'. However I will be using a simplified example applied in the game of Spades as it relates to the intiial bidding. A basic explanation of the rules of the game is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to consider differnt probabilities based on new information as it becomes availble to the bidder. This concept is commonly referred to the Monty Hall problem from the show Let's Make a Deal. It's also known as the Three Prisoners problem. My goal is to try to highlight this during the bidding process of Spades using the code below."

    "### A Breif Overview of Spades\n",
    "\n",
    "Official instructions and more details can be found here:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades\n",
    "\n",
    "Spades are always trump and teams gain points basedon who can most accurately predict the number of tricks their team will take in each successive hand played. The team that obtains the most number of points first, wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many of the family card games we play, I'm sure the rules have deviated from the norm, however the bidding process is relatively standard in Spades. For the purposes of this example, I will be assuming it is played by four people, made up of two teams (called Partnership Spades) using a standard 52-card deck (jokers removed). \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be considering the three phases of the bidding process, before card play actually begins. I will look at different player perspectives in this process. The goal in most cases is to try to bid a 'Nil' due to the fact that the most number of points you can obtain in single hand requires the player to bid, and sucessfully play otu a 'Nil' hand. This basically means that the indiidual player does not expect to take any tricks, and will thus play his or her cards out that way. The three phases could be described as guessingt the number of tricks he or she expects to take at these points... 1. before the card are dealt, 2. after looking at their cards, 3. after hearing what others bid (assuming they are not the first to bid). We will also be ignoring concept of 'blind bids'.\n",
